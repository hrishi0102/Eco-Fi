# Eco-Fi: Decentralized Application for NFT Staking and UN SDGs Alignment

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) aims to facilitate NFT staking to earn ERC-20 rewards while aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Users can connect their web3 wallets to mint ERC1155 NFTs representing Guardian Angels and purchase ERC721 NFTs representing real-world objects like trees, solar panels, and windmills from a shop. The funds from NFT purchases are transferred to NGOs to support initiatives such as tree planting and solar panel installations. Users can then stake their NFTs to earn ERC-20 rewards, incentivizing engagement and contribution to sustainable development efforts.

### Key Components:

- Mint ERC1155 NFTs (Guardian Angels) for free.
- Purchase ERC721 NFTs representing real-world objects.
- Funds from NFT purchases support UN SDGs-aligned initiatives via NGOs.
- Stake NFTs to earn ERC-20 rewards.
- Smart contracts deployed on Polygon zkEVM for scalability and cost-efficiency.

## Features

1. **NFT Minting**: Users can mint ERC1155 NFTs representing Guardian Angels for free upon connecting their web3 wallets. This step initiates their participation in the platform.

2. **NFT Shop**: Users are directed to an NFT shop where they can browse and purchase ERC721 NFTs representing real-world objects. Each purchase contributes to UN SDGs-aligned initiatives as funds are transferred to NGOs for implementation.

3. **NGO Support**: Funds generated from NFT purchases are directed to NGOs to support sustainability initiatives like tree planting, solar panel installations, and more. This ensures transparency and accountability in contributing to UN SDGs.

4. **NFT Staking**: Users can stake their purchased NFTs to earn ERC-20 rewards. Staking incentivizes users to actively engage with the platform and contribute to sustainable development efforts.

## Deployment

- Smart contracts are deployed on Polygon zkEVM for scalability and cost-efficiency.
- Ensure compatibility with Polygon's network and follow best practices for smart contract development and deployment.
